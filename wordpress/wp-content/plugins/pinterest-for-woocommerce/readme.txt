Get your products in front of Pinterest users searching for ideas and things to buy. Connect your WooCommerce store to make your entire catalog browsable.

== Description ==

Pinterest gives people their next great idea. Part collection, part marketplace, it’s a one-stop shop for millions of pinners to source inspiration, new products and new possibilities. It’s like a visual search engine, guiding people to ideas, inspiration and products that are just right for them.

With the Pinterest for WooCommerce extension, you can put your products in front of Pinterest users who are already looking for ideas and things to buy. Connect your WooCommerce store to your *[Pinterest business account](https://business.pinterest.com/)* directly in the WooCommerce app. Your entire catalog will become browsable on Pinterest in just a few clicks.

= Pinterest Ads =

Get started with Pinterest Ads with **$125 free ad credit\*** from Pinterest when you set up Pinterest for WooCommerce and spend $15 on ads! Pinterest *[terms and conditions](https://business.pinterest.com/en-us/business-terms-of-service/)* apply.

= Open-minded and undecided =

People on Pinterest are eager for new ideas, which means they want to hear from you. In fact, 97% of top Pinterest searches are unbranded. Content from brands doesn’t interrupt on Pinterest—it inspires. Shopping features are built into both the organic Pinner experience, and our ad solutions.

We'll also automatically set up your Pinterest tag, and a shop tab on your Pinterest profile.

= Set up your foundation =

*Connect your account*

Install the extension and connect your account to quickly publish Product Pins, automatically update your product catalog every day, and track performance with the Pinterest tag.

*Catalogs*

Turn your entire product catalog into browsable product Pins, all at once.

*Pinterest tag*

Add the tag to your site to measure conversions and to optimize ads for shopping campaigns or retargeting.

Consider longer attribution windows to capture shoppers who take more time to convert.

*Build brand loyalty*

People on Pinterest are nearly 50% more likely to be open to new brands while shopping. And once they find a brand they like, they’re more loyal.

Become their new favorite with merchant solutions like the Shop Tab and the Verified Merchants Program. Shop Tab on profile: Consider this your always-on Pinterest shop. It’s automatically created when you upload your catalog so people can shop right from your profile.

*Verified Merchant Program*

People love to shop from brands they trust. That’s what the Verified Merchant Program is all about. It includes benefits like a “verified” badge on your profile and eligibility for enhanced distribution.

*More about Pinterest*

Pinterest is a visual discovery engine people use to find inspiration for their lives and make it easier to shop for home decor, fashion and style, electronics and more. 450 million people have saved more than 240 billion Pins across a range of interests, which others with similar tastes can discover through search and recommendations.
