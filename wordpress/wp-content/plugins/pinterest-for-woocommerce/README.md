## Development

After cloning the repo. Remember to use the appropiate node version

- `nvm use` to autoselect the node version based on `.nvmrc` file.

Then, install dependencies:

-   `npm install` to install JavaScript dependencies.
-   `composer install` to gather PHP dependencies.

Now you can build the plugin using one of these commands:

-   `npm start`: Build a development version and watch files for changes.
-   `npm build`: Build a production version.
-   `npm build:zip`: Build and production version and package as a zip file.

### Branches

-   `develop` branch is the most up to date code.

### Development tools

There are a number of development tools available as npm scripts. Check the [`package.json`](https://github.com/woocommerce/pinterest-for-woocommerce/blob/develop/package.json) file for more.

-   `npm run lint:js`: Run [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) to validate JavaScript code style.
-   `npm run lint:css`: Run [`stylelint`](https://stylelint.io/) to validate CSS code style.
-   `npm run lint:php`: Run [`phpcs`](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) to validate PHP code style.

Please use these tools to ensure your code changes are consistent with the rest of the code base. This code follows WooCommerce and WordPress standards.

This repository includes an [`EditorConfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) to automate basic code formatting. Please install the appropriate plugin for your editor.


## PHPUnit

### Prerequisites

Install [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/), `git`, `svn`, and either `wget` or `curl`.

Change to the plugin root directory and type:

```bash
$ composer install
```


### Install Test Dependencies

To run the unit tests you need WordPress, [WooCommerce](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce), and the WordPress Unit Test lib (included in the [core development repository](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/)).

Install them using the `install-wp-tests.sh` script:

```bash
$ ./bin/install-wp-tests.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-pass> <db-host>
```

Example:

```bash
$ ./bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_tests root root localhost
```

This script installs the test dependencies into your system's temporary directory and also creates a test database.

You can also specify the path to their directories by setting the following environment variables:

-   `WP_TESTS_DIR`: WordPress Unit Test lib directory
-   `WP_CORE_DIR`: WordPress core directory
-   `WC_DIR`: WooCommerce directory

### Running Tests

Change to the plugin root directory and type:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The tests will execute and you'll be presented with a summary.
